## Arguments

- `$1` = **Either:**
  - A file path to an existing spec/phase document (e.g., `docs/phases/phase-10.md`)
  - OR a free-form description of what user wants to build (e.g., `"Add export button to dashboard"`)

**No explicit language argument needed** - detect automatically from input or user's final words.

---

## Input Mode Detection

**Detection priority:**
1. If `$1` wrapped in quotes → IDEA MODE
2. If starts with `./`, `/`, `docs/`, `src/`, `@` → FILE MODE
3. If ends with `.md`, `.txt`, `.yaml`, `.yml` → FILE MODE
4. Otherwise → IDEA MODE

---

## Language Detection (Auto)

**Default:** English

**Detect language from user's input** - look for language names or codes at the end:

| Language | Triggers (case-insensitive) |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Turkish | `turkish`, `türkçe`, `tr`, `TUR` |
| German | `german`, `almanca`, `deutsch`, `de`, `DEU` |
| Spanish | `spanish`, `español`, `ispanyolca`, `es`, `ESP` |
| French | `french`, `français`, `fransızca`, `fr`, `FRA` |
| Italian | `italian`, `italiano`, `italyanca`, `it`, `ITA` |
| Portuguese | `portuguese`, `português`, `portekizce`, `pt`, `POR` |
| Dutch | `dutch`, `nederlands`, `hollandaca`, `nl`, `NLD` |
| Russian | `russian`, `русский`, `rusça`, `ru`, `RUS` |
| Japanese | `japanese`, `日本語`, `japonca`, `ja`, `JPN` |
| Chinese | `chinese`, `中文`, `çince`, `zh`, `CHN` |
| Korean | `korean`, `한국어`, `korece`, `ko`, `KOR` |
| Arabic | `arabic`, `العربية`, `arapça`, `ar`, `ARA` |

**Also detect if:**
- The idea/description itself is written in a non-English language
- User explicitly says "in [language]" or "[language] please"

**When non-English language is detected:**
- Conduct entire interview in that language
- Use that language in all AskUserQuestion options and descriptions
- Write final spec in that language
- Keep technical terms in English where industry-standard (API, UI, UX, database, etc.)

---

## Phase 0: Calibration (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

Before ANY other questions, you MUST calibrate two things:

### 0.1 Technical Proficiency Assessment

Ask this FIRST using AskUserQuestion:

```
question: "How would you describe your technical background?"
header: "Tech Level"
options:
  - label: "Non-technical"
    description: "I'm a business person, designer, or domain expert. Please explain technical concepts simply."
  - label: "Somewhat technical"
    description: "I understand basics (databases, APIs, frontend/backend) but I'm not a developer."
  - label: "Very technical"
    description: "I'm a developer or have deep technical knowledge. Skip the explanations, let's get specific."
```

**Store the response and adapt ALL subsequent questions:**

| Level | Explanation Style | Question Depth |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Non-technical | ELI5 with analogies, never condescending | Focus on "what" not "how" |
| Somewhat technical | Brief context, then details | Balance business & technical |
| Very technical | Direct technical questions | Include implementation specifics |

### 0.2 Confirm Understanding

After reading file (FILE MODE) or parsing idea (IDEA MODE), summarize your understanding in 2-3 sentences and ask:

```
question: "Is this understanding correct, or should I adjust anything?"
header: "Confirm"
options:
  - label: "Yes, correct"
    description: "Your understanding is accurate, let's proceed."
  - label: "Partially correct"
    description: "Some parts are right, but I need to clarify a few things."
  - label: "No, let me explain"
    description: "My idea is different from what you described."
```

---

## Interview Stages (8 Stages)

### Progress Tracking

Always show progress at the start of each stage:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Stage 2/8: Stakeholders & Users
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Core Philosophy

**Your mission is 100% mutual understanding.** Not "ask questions and move on" — but "understand completely before proceeding."

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎯 GOAL: Error-free spec with zero ambiguity                   │
│                                                                 │
│  ❌ WRONG: "Ask 2-3 questions per stage, then move on"          │
│  ✅ RIGHT: "Ask as many questions as needed until 100% clear"   │
│                                                                 │
│  There is NO question limit. Ask 5, 10, 50, 100 if needed.      │
│  Stay in a stage until FULLY understood. Loop is OK.            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Question Rules

1. **NO QUESTION LIMIT** - Ask as many questions as needed for complete clarity
2. **NEVER SKIP UNCLEAR PARTS** - If something is vague, dig deeper immediately
3. **LOOP UNTIL UNDERSTOOD** - It's OK to ask follow-ups on the same topic
4. **PURPOSE-DRIVEN QUESTIONS** - Every question must serve understanding, never ask just to ask
5. **Use multiSelect: true** for non-mutually-exclusive choices
6. **Always include "Other" implicitly** - AskUserQuestion provides this
7. **Use the "5 Whys" technique** - dig deeper on surface answers
8. **Adapt explanations** based on technical proficiency level
9. **ALWAYS provide a recommendation** - Mark your suggested option with "(Recommended)"

### Handling Ambiguity

When something is unclear, you MUST address it immediately:

```
question: "I want to make sure I understand correctly. When you said '[quote user]', did you mean...?"
header: "Clarify"
options:
  - label: "Interpretation A"
    description: "[Your understanding option 1]"
  - label: "Interpretation B"
    description: "[Your understanding option 2]"
  - label: "Neither - let me explain"
    description: "Both interpretations are wrong, I'll clarify"
```

**Never assume. Never skip. Never leave gaps.**

If user's answer creates NEW ambiguity, ask ANOTHER follow-up. Continue until crystal clear.

### Recommendation Guidelines

For EVERY question, analyze the context and provide your expert recommendation:

```
options:
  - label: "Option A (Recommended)"      ← Your best choice goes FIRST
    description: "Why this is optimal for their use case"
  - label: "Option B"
    description: "Alternative with different tradeoffs"
```

**How to choose recommendations:**
- Consider the user's tech level, team size, timeline
- Favor simplicity over complexity when requirements are unclear
- Prioritize maintainability for non-technical teams
- Consider industry best practices for their domain
- If genuinely uncertain, say "No strong recommendation - depends on X"

### Stage Completion Criteria

**Do NOT move to the next stage until:**
- [ ] All questions in current stage are answered
- [ ] No ambiguous or vague answers remain
- [ ] You could explain this stage to a developer with 100% confidence
- [ ] User has confirmed your understanding is correct

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, stay in the current stage and ask more questions.

---

## Stage 1: PROBLEM & VISION (Why does this exist?)

**Goal:** Understand the root problem before jumping to solutions.

### Questions to explore:

**Problem Discovery:**
- What specific problem or pain point triggered this idea?
- How is this problem currently being solved (workaround)?
- What happens if we don't build this? (Cost of inaction)
- How often does this problem occur? (Daily? Weekly? Monthly?)

**Vision & Success:**
- What does success look like 6 months after launch?
- How will we measure if this feature is successful? (Metrics)
- What would make users say "this is exactly what I needed"?

**Business Context:**
- What's the business priority? (Must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Any deadlines driving this? (Regulatory, competitive, contractual)
- Budget or resource constraints to be aware of?

### Example Questions (with Recommendations):

```
question: "What specific frustration or problem made you think 'we need this feature'?"
header: "Pain Point"
options:
  - label: "Time wasted (Recommended)"
    description: "Current process takes too long - this usually has the clearest ROI"
  - label: "Errors/mistakes"
    description: "People keep making mistakes with the current approach"
  - label: "Missing capability"
    description: "We simply can't do this today, it's a gap"
  - label: "User complaints"
    description: "Users/customers have been asking for this"
```

**Note:** The recommendation above is just an example. In real interviews, analyze the user's context to choose the most relevant recommendation.

---

## Stage 2: STAKEHOLDERS & USERS (Who is involved?)

**Goal:** Identify all people affected by this feature.

### Questions to explore:

**Primary Users:**
- Who will use this feature daily? (Role, not name)
- What's their technical comfort level?
- What devices do they use? (Desktop, mobile, tablet)
- When/where do they typically work? (Office, field, remote)

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- Who else is affected but won't directly use this?
- Who needs to approve or sign off?
- Who will support users if something goes wrong?

**Personas (if needed):**
- Create 1-2 simple personas based on answers
- Include: Role, Goal, Frustration, Technical level

### Example Questions:

```
question: "Who are the primary users of this feature?"
header: "Users"
multiSelect: true
options:
  - label: "Internal team"
    description: "Employees within our organization"
  - label: "External clients"
    description: "Customers or partners outside our organization"
  - label: "Admins/managers"
    description: "People who oversee or configure the system"
  - label: "End consumers"
    description: "General public or end users of our product"
```

---

## Stage 3: FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (What should it do?)

**Goal:** Define concrete actions, inputs, outputs, and business logic.

### Questions to explore:

**Core Actions (use CRUD as a checklist):**
- Create: What can users create/add?
- Read: What information do users need to see?
- Update: What can users modify?
- Delete: What can users remove? (Soft delete vs hard delete?)

**Data Requirements:**
- What information needs to be captured? (Fields)
- Which fields are required vs optional?
- What validation rules apply? (Format, range, uniqueness)
- Where does the data come from? (User input, API, calculation)

**Business Logic:**
- Are there any calculations or formulas?
- Any conditional logic? (If X then Y)
- Any workflows or approval chains?
- Any automations or triggers?

**Integrations:**
- Does this need to connect with other systems?

- Notifications (email, SMS, push)?

### Example Questions:

```
question: "What are the MUST-HAVE actions users need to perform?"
header: "Core Actions"
multiSelect: true
options:
  - label: "View/browse data"
    description: "Users need to see and search through information"
  - label: "Create new entries"
    description: "Users need to add new records or content"
  - label: "Edit existing data"
    description: "Users need to modify information after it's created"
  - label: "Export/download"
    description: "Users need to get data out of the system"
```

---

## Stage 4: UI/UX DESIGN (How should it look and feel?)

**Goal:** Define the user interface and experience in detail.

### Questions to explore:

**Layout & Navigation:**
- Where does this feature live in the app? (New page, modal, sidebar)
- What's the primary layout? (Table, cards, form, dashboard, wizard)
- How do users navigate to this feature?
- Breadcrumbs or back navigation needed?

**Visual Design:**
- Any existing patterns to follow? (Design system)

**State Design (CRITICAL - often missed):**
- **Loading:** What do users see while data loads?
- **Empty:** What if there's no data yet?
- **Error:** How are errors displayed?
- **Success:** How is success confirmed?
- **Partial:** What if only some data is available?
- **Offline:** What if network is unavailable?

### Visual Sketch Example:

```
Imagine this layout for a data table:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔍 Search...          [Filter ▾]  [+ Add New]   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ☐ │ Name          │ Status    │ Date    │ ...  │
│───┼───────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────│
│ ☐ │ Item 1        │ 🟢 Active │ 01/15   │ ⋮    │
│ ☐ │ Item 2        │ 🟡 Pending│ 01/14   │ ⋮    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ◀ 1 2 3 ... 10 ▶           Showing 1-20 of 156 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

What's missing from this sketch?
```

---

## Stage 5: EDGE CASES & ERROR HANDLING (What could go wrong?)

**Goal:** Anticipate and handle exceptional situations.

### Questions to explore:

**Permission & Access:**
- What if user doesn't have permission?
- Different permission levels? (View-only, edit, admin)
- What's visible vs hidden based on role?

**Data Edge Cases:**
- What if required data is missing?
- What if data is invalid or corrupted?
- Maximum limits? (Characters, file size, records)
- Duplicate handling?

**Concurrency:**
- What if two users edit the same thing?
- Locking mechanism needed?
- Real-time sync or manual refresh?

**Network & Performance:**
- Behavior with slow connection?
- Behavior when offline?
- Timeout handling?
- Large dataset handling? (1000+ records)

**User Errors:**
- Undo/redo capabilities?
- Confirmation for destructive actions?
- Auto-save or manual save?
- Recovery from mistakes?

**System Failures:**
- Graceful degradation strategy?
- Retry logic?
- Error logging and alerting?

### Example Questions:

```
question: "What should happen if a user tries to edit something another user is currently editing?"
header: "Concurrent Edit"
options:
  - label: "Lock while editing (Recommended)"
    description: "Only one person can edit at a time - simplest and prevents data loss"
  - label: "Last save wins"
    description: "Whoever saves last overwrites - risky but no blocking"
  - label: "Show conflict"
    description: "Alert users to resolve manually - most control but complex UX"
  - label: "Merge changes"
    description: "Auto-combine changes - technically complex, can cause surprises"
```

---

## Stage 6: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Quality attributes)

**Goal:** Define performance, security, and quality expectations.

### Questions to explore:

**Performance:**
- Acceptable page load time? (< 2 sec is standard)
- How many concurrent users expected?
- Data volume expectations? (Now vs 1 year from now)
- Any real-time requirements?

**Security:**
- Sensitivity of data? (PII, financial, health)
- Authentication requirements?
- Audit trail needed?
- Data retention/deletion policies?

**Reliability:**
- Uptime expectations? (99.9% = 8.7 hours downtime/year)
- Backup/recovery requirements?
- Disaster recovery considerations?

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG compliance level needed?
- Screen reader support?
- Keyboard navigation?
- Color contrast requirements?

**Compliance:**
- Regulatory requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, KVKK)

### Example Questions (adapt to tech level):

**For Non-technical:**
```
question: "How critical is this feature to daily operations?"
header: "Criticality"
options:
  - label: "Important (Recommended)"
    description: "Most features fall here - significant but not catastrophic if down"
  - label: "Nice to have"
    description: "Work continues without it, just less convenient"
  - label: "Business critical"
    description: "Operations stop if this doesn't work - requires extra reliability"
  - label: "Safety critical"
    description: "Could cause harm or legal issues - needs rigorous testing"
```

**For Technical:**
```
question: "What are your performance SLAs?"
header: "Performance"
options:
  - label: "Standard web (Recommended)"
    description: "< 2s page load, 100 concurrent users - sufficient for most apps"
  - label: "High performance"
    description: "< 500ms response, 1000+ concurrent - needs optimization focus"
  - label: "Real-time"
    description: "< 100ms latency, WebSocket/SSE - complex infrastructure"
  - label: "Define specific"
    description: "I have specific numbers in mind"
```

---

## Stage 7: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (How will it be built?)

**ALWAYS ask this stage - adapt explanation depth to tech level.**

For non-technical users: Use ELI5 analogies and plain language. Let them make informed decisions with your expert recommendations.

**Goal:** Capture implementation preferences and constraints.

### Questions to explore:

**Data Storage:**
- New tables/collections needed?
- Relationship to existing data?
- Indexing requirements?
- Caching strategy?

**API Design:**
- RESTful or GraphQL?
- New endpoints needed?
- Rate limiting?
- Versioning?

**Frontend:**
- Client-side or server-side rendering?
- State management approach?
- Component reuse opportunities?

**Integration:**
- Third-party services?
- Authentication/authorization flow?
- Webhook requirements?
- Message queues?

**DevOps:**
- Feature flags needed?
- A/B testing requirements?
- Monitoring and alerting?
- Deployment strategy?

### For Non-technical users
Use ELI5 analogies and provide recommendations:

```
question: "Think of your data like a filing cabinet. How should we organize it?"
header: "Data Storage"
options:
  - label: "One big cabinet (Recommended)"
    description: "All data in one place - simpler to maintain, good for most cases"
  - label: "Separate cabinets by type"
    description: "Different storage for different data - more complex but better for large scale"
  - label: "Let the team decide"
    description: "I trust the developers to choose the best approach"
```

Always include a "Let the team decide" option, but provide your expert recommendation marked with "(Recommended)".

---

## Stage 8: PRIORITIZATION & PHASING (What comes first?)

**Goal:** Break down into manageable phases if needed.

### Questions to explore:

**MoSCoW Prioritization:**
- Must have: Core functionality for MVP
- Should have: Important but not blocking
- Could have: Nice additions if time permits
- Won't have: Explicitly out of scope (for now)

**Phasing:**
- If complex (5+ requirements, 2+ screens), suggest phases
- What's the MVP (minimum viable product)?
- What can be added in v2, v3?

**Dependencies:**
- What must exist before this can be built?
- What other features depend on this?
- External dependencies? (APIs, data, approvals)

**Timeline:**
- Any hard deadlines?
- Preferred release date?
- Iterative releases or big bang?

### Example Questions:

```
question: "If we had to launch in 2 weeks with limited scope, what's the ONE thing this feature must do?"
header: "MVP Core"
options:
  - label: "Option A"
    description: "[First core action identified earlier]"
  - label: "Option B"
    description: "[Second core action identified earlier]"
  - label: "Both A and B"
    description: "Can't launch without both of these"
  - label: "Something else"
    description: "The core is different from what we discussed"
```

---

## Phase: SYNTHESIS

After completing all interview stages:

### 1. Summarize Key Decisions
Present a summary table of all major decisions:

```
| Area | Decision | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Users | Internal finance team | Desktop-first |
| Core action | Export to Excel | Daily use case |
| Layout | Data table with filters | Similar to existing reports |
| Edge case | Show "locked" badge | Prevent concurrent edits |
| MVP | Export + basic filters | v2 adds scheduling |
```

### 2. Identify Conflicts or Gaps
Flag any:
- Contradictory requirements
- Unanswered questions
- Assumptions that need validation
- Dependencies not yet resolved

### 3. Confirm Before Writing
Ask user to confirm the summary before writing the spec:

```
question: "Does this summary accurately capture what we discussed?"
header: "Confirm"
options:
  - label: "Yes, write the spec"
    description: "Summary is accurate, please create the document"
  - label: "Minor adjustments"
    description: "A few small corrections needed first"
  - label: "Major changes"
    description: "We need to revisit some decisions"
```

## Interview Best Practices

### DO:
- **PURSUE 100% CLARITY** - Never settle for "good enough" understanding
- **LOOP ON AMBIGUITY** - Ask follow-ups until crystal clear, even if it takes 20 questions
- Ask "Why?" multiple times (5 Whys technique)
- Use concrete scenarios: "Imagine you're doing X, then Y happens..."
- Reference existing app patterns: "Similar to how [feature] works..."
- Validate understanding: "So if I understand correctly..."
- Dig into edge cases: "What if...?"
- Adapt language to technical level - no jargon for non-technical users
- **PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS** - You're the expert, share your opinion on every question

### DON'T:
- **NEVER ASSUME** - If unclear, ASK. Don't fill in gaps yourself.
- **NEVER RUSH** - Quality of understanding > speed of completion
- **NEVER SKIP** - Every ambiguity must be resolved before moving on
- Ask questions already answered
- Overwhelm with options (max 4 per question)
- Use unexplained acronyms or jargon
- Skip edge cases - they reveal 80% of bugs
- Be condescending when explaining concepts
- Ask questions just to ask - every question must serve understanding

## Execution Flow

**Input received:** `$1`

### Step 1: Detect Mode
- FILE MODE: Verify file exists → Read and analyze
- IDEA MODE: Parse the idea description

### Step 2: Detect Language
- Check for language keywords in input (turkish, german, spanish, etc.)
- Auto-detect from input text if written in non-English
- Default to English if unclear

### Step 3: Calibration (Phase 0)
- Ask technical proficiency level FIRST
- Confirm understanding of the feature/idea

### Step 4: Interview Stages (1-8)
- Progress through each stage methodically
- Adapt question depth to tech level
- Stage 7 (Technical): Use ELI5 for non-technical users, never skip
- **NO QUESTION LIMIT** - Ask as many as needed for 100% clarity
- **LOOP IF NEEDED** - Stay in a stage until fully understood
- **NEVER SKIP AMBIGUITY** - Clarify immediately, don't assume
- ALWAYS include your recommendation marked with "(Recommended)"
- Do NOT proceed to next stage until current stage is 100% clear

### Step 5: Synthesis
- Summarize decisions in a table
- Flag conflicts or gaps
- Get user confirmation

### Step 6: Write Spec
- Use the comprehensive template
- Include all gathered information
- Mark open questions clearly

### Step 7: Save
- FILE MODE: Update existing file
- IDEA MODE: Ask where to save, then create file
